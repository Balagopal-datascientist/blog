## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, but understanding their decision-making process remains challenging. [ReasonGraph](https://github.com/ZongqianLi/ReasonGraph?tab=readme-ov-file) is a web-based framework designed to visualize and analyze LLM reasoning paths, providing better interpretability and debugging for AI researchers and practitioners.

## What is ReasonGraph?

ReasonGraph is an interactive platform that maps out the logical flow of LLM-generated responses in a structured, graph-based manner. Breaking down reasoning steps into nodes and edges, offers an intuitive way to explore how an LLM concludes. By studying the prompts in the code one can arrive at a better understanding of prompt engineering concepts as well 

### Key Features:
- **Graph-based Representation**: Converts LLM reasoning chains into a structured graph for better interpretability.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Users can navigate reasoning steps, highlight key decisions, and analyze dependencies.
- **Debugging & Evaluation**:  It helps researchers identify biases, hallucinations, and logical inconsistencies.
- **Customizable Framework**: Supports multiple LLMs and can be adapted for various applications.

## Why is it Important?

1. **Improves Transparency**: LLMs often function as black boxes. ReasonGraph sheds light on their decision-making.
2. **Enhances Debugging**: Identifies logical flaws and biases in model responses.
3. **Facilitates Research**: Provides a structured method for studying AI reasoning and improving model performance.

## How it Works

- **Input Processing**: The user provides a prompt to the LLM.
- **Reasoning Extraction**: The LLM generates responses with intermediate reasoning steps.
- **Graph Construction**: The reasoning path is structured as a directed graph.
- **Visualization & Analysis**: The user interacts with the graph to inspect relationships and decision paths.

## Applications

- **AI Research & Debugging**: Helps in fine-tuning models and understanding reasoning failures.
- **Education & Training**: Assists in teaching logical reasoning using AI-generated graphs.
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Useful for multi-step decision-making in tasks like law, medicine, and finance.

## Example use case of ReasonGraph

- **Scenario**: An LLM is tasked with answering a complex legal question.
- **Input**: "What are the legal implications of AI-generated content in copyright law?"
- **Graph Visualization**:  
    Below is an example of how ReasonGraph visualizes the reasoning path for the given input.

    The graph highlights key reasoning nodes and their connections, making it easier to trace the logical flow and identify potential issues.




## Conclusion

ReasonGraph provides an innovative approach to making LLMs more interpretable and transparent. As AI continues to evolve, tools like this will be crucial for improving trust and reliability in automated reasoning systems.
